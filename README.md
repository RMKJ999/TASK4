# TASK4
Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture- based control systems.
I had the opportunity to work on an innovative project: developing a hand gesture recognition model using deep learning techniques. 🖐️🤖✨

Here’s a summary of what I accomplished:

Dataset Exploration: Utilized the Leap Gesture Recognition dataset, preprocessed the images, and prepared them for model training. 📊

Data Augmentation: Applied various augmentation techniques to enhance the model’s robustness and generalization capabilities. 🔄

Model Development: Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify hand gestures, leveraging multiple convolutional and pooling layers. 🧠

Training & Evaluation: Trained the model and evaluated its performance, achieving impressive accuracy in recognizing different hand gestures. 📈

Visualization: Analyzed training history with plots to understand model performance and fine-tune it for better accuracy. 📉

This project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I’m grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for the opportunity to dive deep into image recognition and machine learning. 🙌
